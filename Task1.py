"""# Task
Write a Python script to fine-tune a GPT-2 model on a custom dataset for text generation, including steps for installing libraries, loading and preprocessing data, loading the model, defining training arguments, fine-tuning, and generating text.

Install the `transformers` and `datasets` libraries from Hugging Face.

**Reasoning**:
Install the required libraries using pip.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   Attempting to load several datasets ("glue", "wikitext", "imdb", "samsum", and even a simple dummy dataset) consistently resulted in a `ValueError: Invalid pattern: '**' can only be an entire path component`. This error prevented the necessary data loading and preprocessing steps from being completed.
*   Loading the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library was successful.
*   Defining the training arguments using `TrainingArguments` was initially problematic due to unrecognized parameters (`evaluation_strategy`, `save_strategy`, `load_best_model_at_end`) but was successful after removing these arguments.
*   Fine-tuning the model using the `Trainer` failed because the dataset could not be loaded and preprocessed in the preceding steps, resulting in the `tokenized_datasets` variable being unavailable.
*   Generating text using the model initially failed to load the fine-tuned model from the local directory due to an invalid directory name but successfully fell back to using the default "gpt2" model.
*   An error related to PyTorch tensors during tokenization for text generation was resolved by explicitly installing the `torch` library.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The primary blocker for this task was the persistent `ValueError: Invalid pattern: '**' can only be an entire path component` encountered during dataset loading. This issue needs to be diagnosed and resolved in the environment or with the `datasets` library installation before any data-dependent steps like preprocessing and training can be performed.
*   After resolving the dataset loading issue and successfully fine-tuning the model, ensure the model is saved to a valid path that can be loaded later for text generation.
